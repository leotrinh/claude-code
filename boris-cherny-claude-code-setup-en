# Boris Cherny (@bcherny) - How I Use Claude Code (Thread Jan 2, 2026)

## Card 1: Introduction
I'm Boris, creator of Claude Code.  
Lots of people asked how I personally use it → here's my setup.

My setup is surprisingly vanilla — Claude Code works great out of the box, no heavy customization needed.  
Everyone on the Claude Code team uses it very differently.

## Card 2: 5 Claudes running in parallel in Terminal
I run 5 Claude instances in separate terminal tabs (numbered 1–5).  
Use system notifications to know which tab needs my input.  
→ iTerm2 config link: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/terminal-config#iterm-2-system-notifications

## Card 3: Terminal + Web + Mobile combo
Run 5–10 more Claudes in parallel on https://claude.ai/code  
Hand-off sessions between local ↔ web using & or --teleport  
Occasionally start sessions from my phone (Claude iOS app) in the morning → check back later.

## Card 4: Model choice
Use **Opus 4.5 with thinking** for literally everything.  
Even though it's bigger/slower than Sonnet, less steering needed + better tool use → ends up faster overall.

## Card 5: Shared claude.md knowledge base
Whole team shares one https://code.claude.com/docs file (checked into git).  
Whenever Claude does something wrong → we add a rule so it doesn't repeat next time.  
Other teams maintain their own docs files.

## Card 6: Tagging @.claude in code reviews
In coworkers' PRs, I tag @.claude to suggest adding rules to the docs.  
We use the Claude Code GitHub Action (/install-github-action).  
Similar to @danshipper's Compounding Engineering concept.

## Card 7: Plan mode is the most important step
Most sessions start in **Plan mode** (shift+tab ×2).  
Iterate on the plan with Claude until it's solid → then switch to **auto-accept edits** mode → usually lands the PR in one shot.  
A great plan determines 70–80% of success.

## Card 8: Slash commands for inner-loop workflows
Create slash commands for anything I do many times a day.  
Example: /commit-push-pr (auto git status, commit, push, create PR).  
Commands stored in .claude/commands/ and checked into git.

## Card 9: Frequently used sub-agents
- code-simplifier: cleans up/simplifies code after main work  
- verify-app: detailed end-to-end testing instructions for Claude Code  
→ Treat subagents like reusable automation steps for most PRs.

## Card 10: PostToolUse hook for formatting
Hook auto-formats Claude's code output → catches the last 10% to avoid CI formatting failures.

## Card 11: Avoid --dangerously-skip-permissions
Instead, use /permissions to pre-allow safe bash commands.  
Most rules saved in .claude/settings.json and shared with the team.

## Card 12: Claude uses external tools itself
Claude searches/posts to Slack (via MCP server), runs BigQuery queries, fetches Sentry logs, etc.  
Slack MCP config checked into .mcp.json and shared team-wide.

## Card 13: Handling long-running tasks + verification
For long tasks:  
a) Prompt Claude to verify with a background agent when done  
b) Use agent Stop hook for determinism  
c) Use ralph-wiggum plugin (idea from @GeoffreyHuntley)  
→ Run in sandbox with --permission-mode=dontAsk so Claude cooks uninterrupted.

## Card 14: The #1 secret to great results – Verification Loop
Give Claude a reliable way to **verify its own work**.  
→ Boosts final quality 2–3×.

Example: Claude auto-tests every change to https://claude.ai/code using the Chrome extension → opens browser, tests UI, iterates until it feels good.

## Card 15: Wrap-up + question back
That's my setup in a nutshell.
